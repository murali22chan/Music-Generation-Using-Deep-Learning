# Music-Generation-Using-Deep-Learning
## Overview
Long Short Term Memory is a Artificial Recurrent Neural Network which is mainly used in time series data. <br>
The technique used to generate music is same as the technique used to predict the next word in a sentence using LSTM. Here, Instead of predicting the next word, next note is predicted <br>
The File **Main.ipynb** has the entire pipeline for the project. <br>
The Directory **models** have the pretrained model. <br>
The Directory **piano_midi** has the dataset for the training.
